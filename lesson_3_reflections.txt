1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  This makes sense because you have a "backup" of your work and you can publish revisions accordingly,
  rather than having all of your files local

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  You may want to pull a different branch than the master, or you may want to work from a specific branch (ie. the one You have been working on) - rather than working from a large project where there can be many contributors.
