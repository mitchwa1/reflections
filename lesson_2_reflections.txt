1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  when you initialize a repository it creates a sort of "instance" or a placeholder for your files you may soon commit.  

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
  staging area is between commit and git - it has no direct affiliation with the working directory, except through "status" - this is valuable because it does not change anything directly in your working directory without a "commit"
